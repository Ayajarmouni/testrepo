Frameworks such as Ruby-on-Rails and Django have been getting a lot of attention as a result.     For PHP coders, the Zend Framework offers that same promise without the need to move away from PHP. This powerful collection of components can be used in part or as a whole to speed up the development process. Zend Framework has the backing of Zend Technologies; the driving force behind the PHP programming language in which it is written. The first production release of the Zend Framework became available in July of 2007.

Enterprise OSGi addresses several shortcomings of existing enterprise platforms, such as allowing the creation of better maintainable and extensible applications, and provide a simpler, easier-to-use, light-weight solution to enterprise software development.',
    longDescription: "A good application framework greatly simplifies a developer's task by providing reusable code modules that solve common, tedious, or complex tasks. Writing a great framework requires an extraordinary set of skills-ranging from deep knowledge of a programming language and target platform to a crystal-clear view of the problem space where the applications to be developed using the frameworkwill be used.    OSGi Application Frameworks shows a Java developer how to build frameworks based on the OSGi service platform. OSGi, an emerging Java-based technology for developing modular applications, is a great tool for framework building. A framework itself, OSGi allows the developer to create a more intuitive, modular framework by isolating many of the key challenges the framework developer faces.    This book begins by describing the process, principles, and tools you must master to build a custom application framework. It introduces thefundamental concepts of OSGi, and then shows you how to put OSGi to work building various types of frameworks that solve specific development problems.    OSGi is particularly useful for building frameworksthat can be easily extended by developers to create domain-specific applications. This book teaches the developer to break down a problemdomain into its abstractions and then use OSGi to create a modular framework solution. Along the way, the developer learns software engineering practices intrinsic to framework building that result in systems with better software qualities, such as flexibility, extensibility, and maintainability.    Author Alexandre Alves guides you through major concepts, such as the definition of programming models and modularization techniques, and complements them with samples that have real applicability using industry-proved technologies, such as Spring-DMand Equinox.",

    shortDescription: `"Flexible Rails created a standard to which Ihold other technical books. You definitely get your money's worth."`,
    longDescription: `Rails is a fantastic tool for web application development, but its Ajax-driven interfaces stop short of the richness you gain with a tool like Adobe Flex. Simply put, Flex is the most productive way to build the UI of rich Internet applications, and Rails is the most productive way to rapidly build a database-backed CRUDapplication. Together, they're an amazing combination.    Flexible Rails is a book about how to use Ruby on Rails and Adobe Flex to buildnext-generation rich Internet applications (RIAs). The book takes you to the leading edge of RIA development, presenting examples in Flex3 and Rails 2.    This book is not an exhaustive Ruby on Rails tutorial, nor a Flex reference manual. (Adobe ships over 3000 pages of PDFreference documentation with Flex.) Instead, it's an extensive tutorial, developed iteratively, how to build an RIA using Flex and Rails together. You learn both the specific techniques you need to use Flexand Rails together as well as the development practices that make the combination especially powerful.    The example application built in the book is MIT-licensed, so readers can use it as the basis for their own applications. In fact, one reader has already built an agile project management tool based on the book example!    With this book,you learn Flex by osmosis. You can read the book and follow along even if you have never used Flex before. Consider it "Flex Immersion." You absorb the key concepts of Flex as you go through the process of building the application.    You will also learn how Flex and Rails integrate with HTTPService and XML, and see how RESTful Rails controller design gracefully supports using the same controller actions for Flex and HTML clients. The author will show you how Cairngorm can be used to architect larger Flex applications, including tips to use Cairngorm in a less verbose way with HTTPService to talk to Rails.    Flexible Rails is for both Rails developers who are interested in Flex, and Flex developers who are interested in Rails. For a Rails developer, Flex allows for more dynamic and engaging user interfaces than arepossible with Ajax. For a Flex developer, Rails provides a way to rapidly build the ORM and services layer of the application.`,

    longDescription: "In complex software projects, managing the development process can be as critical to success as writing the code itself. A project may involve dozens of developers, managers, architects, testers, and customers, hundreds of builds, and thousands of opportunities to get off-track. To keep tabs on the people, tasks, and components of a medium- to large-scale project, most teams use a development system that allows for easy monitoring, follow-up, and accountability.    Microsoft Team Foundation Server 2008 (TFS), the server component of Microsoft's Visual Studio Team System (VSTS), provides a powerful collaborative platform for software-development teams. The product offers an integrated toolset for tracking work items, creating test cases, managing source code, generating builds, constructing database schemas, and so on. Because in software development one size does not fit all, TFS provides process customization, project management, and reporting capabilities to build solutions around your requirements.    Team Foundation Server 2008 in Action is a hands-on guide to Team Foundation Server 2008. Written for developers with a good handle on TFS basics, this book shows you how to solve real-life problems.It's not a repetition of Microsoft's product documentation.

    longDescription: `It's easy to get excited about building a new software project from scratch. So-called "greenfield" projects often involve learning new technology and the opportunity for experimentation. Working on established software projects may seem less glamorous.   Most software developers have inherited a monolithic application where the day-to-day tasks involve maintenance, incremental improvements, or even cleaning up the mess another programmer left behind. These legacy or brownfield projects often have tightly coupled components, low cohesion, and poor separation of concerns, making them fragileand resistant to change.    Brownfield Application Development in .Net shows you how to approach legacy applications with the state-of-the-art concepts, patterns, and tools you've learned to apply to new projects. Using an existing application as an example, this book guidesyou in applying the techniques and best practices you need to make it more maintainable and receptive to change.    Starting with the build process and the introduction of unit tests, the authors show you how to set up the application so that in later chapters, you can make incremental changes aimed at decoupling components from each other. Each practice introduced will increase your confidence and ability to make subsequent changes to your code.    As the book proceeds, the authors introduce frameworks and tools commonly used today while still approaching the subject from a conceptual level so that you can substitute alternate tools as appropriate. This book examines the reasons why a tool is necessary, not the tool itself. Because the book is based on the authors' experiences, Brownfield Application Development in.Net moves beyond the theories and shows you the techniques you needto be successful.`,

    longDescription: `MongoDB is a document-oriented database that'shighly scalable and delivers very high-performance, especially with massive data sets that need to be spread across multiple servers. It blends the things you expect with any database   like indexing, querying, and high availability   with powerful new features like easy horizontal scaling ("auto-sharding"), map/reduce aggregation, and a flexible document data model to support dynamic schemas.    MongoDB In Action is a comprehensive guide to MongoDB for application developers. The book begins by explaining what makes MongoDB unique and describing its ideal use cases. A series of tutorials designed for MongoDB mastery then leads into detailed examples for leveraging MongoDB in e-commerce, social networking, analytics, and other common applications.  Along the way, all of MongoDB's major features are covered, including:        * Indexes and explain plans for efficient queries      * Atomic operations for managing simple data structures and manipulating complex, rich documents      * GridFS for storing and managing large binary objects (images, videos, etc.) in MongoDB      * Map-reduce for custom aggregations and reporting      * Master-slave replicationand replica sets for automated failover      * Auto-sharding for automated horizontal scaling    The handy reference section on schema design patterns will help ease the transition from the relational data model of SQL to MongoDB's document-based data model. The numerous, detailed examples are implemented in Ruby and include comprehensive explanations.    MongoDB has been gaining traction in the developer community for its speed, flexibility, scalability, and ease of use. With production deployments that include SourceForge, Foursquare, and Shutterfly, MongoDB is proving to be a robust and reliable database system that keeps developers happy. Covering everything from installation to application design to deployment, MongoDB In Action is written forthe application developer who wants to take advantage of MongoDB andget up and running quickly.`,

    longDescription: `3D User Interfaces with Java 3D is a practicalguide for providing next-generation applications with 3D user interfaces for manipulation of in-scene objects. Emphasis is on standalone and web-based business applications, such as for online sales and mass customization, but much of what this book offers has broad applicability to 3D user interfaces in other pursuits such as scientific visualization and gaming.  This book provides an extensive conceptual framework for 3D user interface techniques, and an in-depth introductionto user interface support in the Java 3D API, including such topics as picking, collision, and drag-and-drop. Many of the techniques are demonstrated in a Java 3D software framework included with the book, which also provides developers with many general-purpose building blocks for constructing their own user interfaces.    Applications and their use of 3D are approached realistically. The book is geared towards sophisticated user interfaces for the "everyday user" who doesn't have a lot of time to learn another application--much less a complicated one--and an everyday computer system without exotic devices like head mounted displays and data gloves. Perhaps the best description of this book is: "A roadmap from Java 3D to 'Swing 3D'."`,

The Well-Grounded Rubyist takes you from interested novice to proficient practitioner. It's a beautifully written tutorial that begins with the basic steps to get your first Ruby program up and running and goes on to explore sophisticated topics like callable objects, reflection, and threading The book concentrates on the language, preparing you for any way you may choose to use Ruby. Whether the topic is simple or tough, the book's easy-to-follow examples and explanations give you immediate confidence as you build your Ruby programming skills.    The Well-Grounded Rubyist is a thoroughly revised and updated edition of the best-selling Ruby for Rails. In this new book, expert author David A. Black moves beyond Rails and presents a broader view ofRuby. It covers Ruby 1.9, and keeps the same sharp focus and clear writing that made Ruby for Rails stand out.    It's no wonder one reader commented: "The technical depth is just right to not distract beginners, yet detailed enough for more advanced readers."`,

In the Web 2.0 era, leveraging the collective power of user contributions, interactions, and feedback is the key to marketdominance. A new category of powerful programming techniques lets you discover the patterns, inter-relationships, and individual profiles  the collective intelligence   locked in the data people leave behind as they surf websites, post blogs, and interact with other users.  Collective Intelligence in Action is a hands-on guidebook for implementing collective-intelligence concepts using Java. It is the firstJava-based book to emphasize the underlying algorithms and technicalimplementation of vital data gathering and mining techniques like analyzing trends, discovering relationships, and making predictions. Itprovides a pragmatic approach to personalization by combining content-based analysis with collaborative approaches.    This book is for Java developers implementing collective intelligence in real, high-useapplications. Following a running example in which you harvest and use information from blogs, you learn to develop software that you canembed in your own applications. The code examples are immediately reusable and give the Java developer a working collective intelligence toolkit.    Along the way, you work with, a number of APIs and open-source toolkits including text analysis and search using Lucene, web-crawling using Nutch, and applying machine learning algorithms using WEKA and the Java Data Mining (JDM) standard.",

    longDescription: `If you're a Java developer, you've almost certainly heard of OSGi   and also heard that it's becoming quite a big deal. But you may still be wondering exactly "What is OSGi "    Simplyput, OSGi is a technology that allows you to create highly modular Java applications. It introduces a logical and physical module format,called a bundle, for explicitly structuring your application as a set of interconnected modules. OSGi lets you install, start, stop, update, or uninstall modules at execution time without taking down your entire system. In addition, OSGi defines a local service-oriented approach for creating applications out of loosely coupled components.    With the prevalence of modern component and service-based architectures, OSGi is becoming increasingly important. It meshes well with suchapproaches and greatly simplifies their creation and management. It's the backbone of Eclipse's plugin system as well as many recent JavaEE containers, such as GlassFish v3, WebSphere v6.1, and WebLogic Event Server. Even the SpringSource Application Platform is built on topof it.    OSGi in Action is a comprehensive guide to OSGi with two primary goals.    First, it provides a clear introduction to OSGi concepts with examples that are relevant both for architects and developers. The central idea of OSGi is modularity, so you start by learning about OSGi bundles.    You'll then see how OSGi handles module lifecycles and follow up with how it promotes service-oriented interaction among application components.    With the core concepts well in hand,you'll explore numerous application scenarios and techniques. How much of OSGi do you actually need  How do you embed OSGi inside other containers  What are the best practices for migrating legacy systems to OSGi  How can you embrace and make the most of system dynamism     Expert authors Richard S.

    longDescription: 'The Google Web Toolkit (GWT) is a new technology from Google that automatically translates Java into JavaScript, making Ajax applications easier to code and deploy. GWT in Action is a comprehensive tutorial for Java developers interested in building thenext generation of rich, web-based applications. This book was written by Robert Hanson, creator of the popular GWT Widget Library, and Adam Tacy, a major contributor to the GWT Widget Library.    The Web is experiencing a new growth with an emphasis on rich, web-based applications. These applications can be difficult to build because they rely on JavaScript, which lacks the sophisticated object-oriented structures and static typing of Java, they are tricky to debug, and they require you to manage numerous browser inconsistencies.    In May of 2006 Google released the Google Web Toolkit. GWT enables developers tocreate Ajax applications in Java. With GWT, you can build your applications using a real object-oriented language and take advantage of Java tools like Eclipse that are already available. Instead of trying to bring tool support to Ajax, Google brought Ajax to a place where the tools already existed.    GWT in Action shows you how to take advantage of these exciting new tools. This clearly-written book is packed with hands-on GWT examples. You   ll absorb the GWT philosophy as you build your first working GWT application.    The book begins by exploring the main features of GWT, including    Compiling Java to JavaScript, the magic that really defines GWT  Building client-side components  Convenient JUnit integration and testing  Interacting with JavaScript and existing JavaScript libraries  Internationalization  You ll also see how GWT compares to other toolkits.    GWT in Action shows you how to set up your development environment, use and create widgets, communicate with the server, and much more. Readers will follow an example running throughout the book and quickly master the basics of GWT: widgets, panels, and event handling. The book covers the full development cycle, from setting up your development environment, to building the application, then deploying it to the web server.

    longDescription: `In December 2008, the Merb team announced thatthey will be collaborating with the Rails core team on the next versions of Merb and Rails. Rather than maintaining parallel tracks, Merb2 and Rails 3 will merge, preserving the flexible configuration and advanced features that Merb users love along with the rapid productivity and ease-of-use that makes Rails shine. As Engine Yard developer (and Manning author) Yehuda Katz puts it, "Effectively, Merb 2 is Rails 3."    Rails 3 in Action will provide a thorough introduction to Ruby-based web development using Rails. Like Rails 3 itself, this bookcombines Merb and Rails in the form of authors Yehuda Katz, Merb Lead Developer.    As a developer, you'll benefit from several big advantages to this change:  Rails becomes more modular, by building on rails core with the ability to opt in or out of specific components and making it possible to replace parts of Rails without disturbing otherparts.  Merb performance improvements flow into Rails, including benchmarking applications so developers can see which optimizations havereal-world impact.  A defined public API with a test suite, so usersand plugin developers have a stable API to build against.  A "core" version of Rails, like Merb's current core generator, that makes it easy to select just the parts that are important for your app.  DataMapper and Sequel support as first-class ORMs, along with ActiveRecord as the default.  Rack support in Rails 3, to improve the state of modular, sharable logic between applications.  The Rails 3 team is moving full steam ahead building the new version. The Merb team will startworking on Rails immediately, and also continue to fix bugs and resolve other major issues in the current release of Merb. Interim versions of Merb will help ease the transition to Rails 3. In particular, Merb releases with deprecation notices and other transitional mechanisms will assist developers in tracking down the changes between Merb 1.x and Rails 3.    If you've already learned Merb, Rails 3 in Action will help you parlay that knowledge into the new Rails code base. If you're a long time Rails developer, it will help you get up to speed with all the new Rails 3 features and changes.`,

Why is this open-source tool so popular  Because it automates a tedious task: persisting your Java objects to a relational database. The inevitable mismatch between your object-oriented code and the relational database requires you to write code that maps one to the other. This code is often complex, tedious and costly to develop. Hibernate does the mapping for you.    Not only that, Hibernate makes it easy. Positioned as a layer between your application and your database, Hibernate takes care of loading and saving of objects. Hibernate applications are cheaper, more portable, and more resilient to change. Andthey perform better than anything you are likely to develop yourself.    Hibernate in Action carefully explains the concepts you need, then gets you going. It builds on a single example to show you how to use Hibernate in practice, how to deal with concurrency and transactions, how to efficiently retrieve objects and use caching.    The authors created Hibernate and they field questions from the Hibernate community every day - they know how to make Hibernate sing. Knowledge andinsight seep out of every pore of this book.',

    longDescription: 'Unlike some complex and invasive persistence solutions, iBATIS keeps O/RM clean and simple. It is an elegant persistence framework that maps classes to SQL statements and keeps the learning curve flat. The iBATIS approach makes apps easy to code, test, and deploy. You write regular SQL and iBATIS gives you standard objects for persistence and retrieval. There   s no need to change existing database schemas   iBATIS is tolerant of legacy databases (even badly designed ones).    iBATIS in Action is a comprehensive tutorial onthe framework and an introduction to the iBATIS philosophy. Clinton Begin and coauthors lead you through the core features, including configuration, statements, and transactions. Because you   ll need more than the basics, it explores sophisticated topics like Dynamic SQL and data layer abstraction. You   ll also learn a useful skill: how to extend iBATIS itself. A complete, detailed example shows you how to put iBATIS to work. Topics are clearly organized and easily accessiblefor reference.',

The much-anticipated 2 release adds powerful new features along with the ability to code in multiple languages and integrate your work with Visual Studio and the new Expression suite of tools. This book delivers real-world examples and in-depth walkthroughs tohelp you confidently enhance your web applications using Silverlight2.    Silverlight 2 in Action devotes extensive coverage to flexiblelayout components, the extensible control model, the communication framework, and the data-binding features   all cornerstones of software development. Author and Microsoft MVP Chad Campbell also describes rich media and vivid graphical and animation features. The final chapters include a variety of Silverlight deployment scenarios.    In addition to the fundamentals of Silverlight, you'll be introduced to architectural components such as the Silverlight object model. The book addresses the developer/designer collaboration model Silverlight enables, showing the developer how to include the designer effectively inthe project workflow. This model is illustrated throughout the examples.    For ongoing reader support, the author will maintain a dedicated book-support website providing up-to-the-minute working examples,complete with source code, all in Silverlight.`,

    shortDescription: `"Flexible Rails created a standard to which Ihold other technical books. You definitely get your money's worth."`,
    longDescription: `Rails is a fantastic tool for web application development, but its Ajax-driven interfaces stop short of the richness you gain with a tool like Adobe Flex. Simply put, Flex is the most productive way to build the UI of rich Internet applications, and Rails is the most productive way to rapidly build a database-backed CRUDapplication. Together, they're an amazing combination.    Flexible Rails is a book about how to use Ruby on Rails and Adobe Flex to buildnext-generation rich Internet applications (RIAs). The book takes you to the leading edge of RIA development, presenting examples in Flex3 and Rails 2.    This book is not an exhaustive Ruby on Rails tutorial, nor a Flex reference manual. (Adobe ships over 3000 pages of PDFreference documentation with Flex.) Instead, it's an extensive tutorial, developed iteratively, how to build an RIA using Flex and Rails together. You learn both the specific techniques you need to use Flexand Rails together as well as the development practices that make the combination especially powerful.    The example application built in the book is MIT-licensed, so readers can use it as the basis for their own applications. In fact, one reader has already built an agile project management tool based on the book example!    With this book,you learn Flex by osmosis. You can read the book and follow along even if you have never used Flex before. Consider it "Flex Immersion." You absorb the key concepts of Flex as you go through the process of building the application.    You will also learn how Flex and Rails integrate with HTTPService and XML, and see how RESTful Rails controller design gracefully supports using the same controller actions for Flex and HTML clients. The author will show you how Cairngorm can be used to architect larger Flex applications, including tips to use Cairngorm in a less verbose way with HTTPService to talk to Rails.    Flexible Rails is for both Rails developers who are interested in Flex, and Flex developers who are interested in Rails. For a Rails developer, Flex allows for more dynamic and engaging user interfaces than arepossible with Ajax. For a Flex developer, Rails provides a way to rapidly build the ORM and services layer of the application.`,

    longDescription: `It's easy to get excited about building a new software project from scratch. So-called "greenfield" projects often involve learning new technology and the opportunity for experimentation. Working on established software projects may seem less glamorous.   Most software developers have inherited a monolithic application where the day-to-day tasks involve maintenance, incremental improvements, or even cleaning up the mess another programmer left behind. These legacy or brownfield projects often have tightly coupled components, low cohesion, and poor separation of concerns, making them fragileand resistant to change.    Brownfield Application Development in .Net shows you how to approach legacy applications with the state-of-the-art concepts, patterns, and tools you've learned to apply to new projects. Using an existing application as an example, this book guidesyou in applying the techniques and best practices you need to make it more maintainable and receptive to change.    Starting with the build process and the introduction of unit tests, the authors show you how to set up the application so that in later chapters, you can make incremental changes aimed at decoupling components from each other. Each practice introduced will increase your confidence and ability to make subsequent changes to your code.    As the book proceeds, the authors introduce frameworks and tools commonly used today while still approaching the subject from a conceptual level so that you can substitute alternate tools as appropriate. This book examines the reasons why a tool is necessary, not the tool itself. Because the book is based on the authors' experiences, Brownfield Application Development in.Net moves beyond the theories and shows you the techniques you needto be successful.`,

    longDescription: `3D User Interfaces with Java 3D is a practicalguide for providing next-generation applications with 3D user interfaces for manipulation of in-scene objects. Emphasis is on standalone and web-based business applications, such as for online sales and mass customization, but much of what this book offers has broad applicability to 3D user interfaces in other pursuits such as scientific visualization and gaming.  This book provides an extensive conceptual framework for 3D user interface techniques, and an in-depth introductionto user interface support in the Java 3D API, including such topics as picking, collision, and drag-and-drop. Many of the techniques are demonstrated in a Java 3D software framework included with the book, which also provides developers with many general-purpose building blocks for constructing their own user interfaces.    Applications and their use of 3D are approached realistically. The book is geared towards sophisticated user interfaces for the "everyday user" who doesn't have a lot of time to learn another application--much less a complicated one--and an everyday computer system without exotic devices like head mounted displays and data gloves. Perhaps the best description of this book is: "A roadmap from Java 3D to 'Swing 3D'."`,

    longDescription: 'This comprehensive guide provides developers with the necessary skills to develop WAP applications and build dynamic Web sites for wireless use. Dynamic WAP Application Development first introduces the Wireless Application Protocol (WAP) and offers an in-depth explanation of the prominent wireless languages.    The authors begin with HDML (Handheld Device Markup Language), the first wireless language and one still supported by many Internet-enabled phones in the United States. They next cover WML (Wireless Markup Language),the XML-based successor to HDML that is supported by most phones worldwide. The third language described is WMLScript, the client-side scripting language of the wireless world that enables the developer to include procedure logic within their WML markup. In addition to hands-on practice with each of these languages, the book examines the issues involved in wireless application design and in converting HDML documents into WML.    The book also provides an overview of Microsoft Active Server Pages (ASP) and Java Servlets, and guides developers through the process of creating dynamic WAP applications using these server-side technologies.    Application design specific to the small display and limited memory capacity of wireless phones is also covered.Advanced topics include security, performance, and the intricacies of WAP gateways. The book also includes robust case studies that put WAP concepts into practice.    This book is geared for developers who are called upon to extend existing Web services to wireless phone subscribers and for those who need to understand the resources involved in the development and deployment of WAP applications.',

In the Web 2.0 era, leveraging the collective power of user contributions, interactions, and feedback is the key to marketdominance. A new category of powerful programming techniques lets you discover the patterns, inter-relationships, and individual profiles  the collective intelligence   locked in the data people leave behind as they surf websites, post blogs, and interact with other users.  Collective Intelligence in Action is a hands-on guidebook for implementing collective-intelligence concepts using Java. It is the firstJava-based book to emphasize the underlying algorithms and technicalimplementation of vital data gathering and mining techniques like analyzing trends, discovering relationships, and making predictions. Itprovides a pragmatic approach to personalization by combining content-based analysis with collaborative approaches.    This book is for Java developers implementing collective intelligence in real, high-useapplications. Following a running example in which you harvest and use information from blogs, you learn to develop software that you canembed in your own applications. The code examples are immediately reusable and give the Java developer a working collective intelligence toolkit.    Along the way, you work with, a number of APIs and open-source toolkits including text analysis and search using Lucene, web-crawling using Nutch, and applying machine learning algorithms using WEKA and the Java Data Mining (JDM) standard.",

    longDescription: `If you're a Java developer, you've almost certainly heard of OSGi   and also heard that it's becoming quite a big deal. But you may still be wondering exactly "What is OSGi "    Simplyput, OSGi is a technology that allows you to create highly modular Java applications. It introduces a logical and physical module format,called a bundle, for explicitly structuring your application as a set of interconnected modules. OSGi lets you install, start, stop, update, or uninstall modules at execution time without taking down your entire system. In addition, OSGi defines a local service-oriented approach for creating applications out of loosely coupled components.    With the prevalence of modern component and service-based architectures, OSGi is becoming increasingly important. It meshes well with suchapproaches and greatly simplifies their creation and management. It's the backbone of Eclipse's plugin system as well as many recent JavaEE containers, such as GlassFish v3, WebSphere v6.1, and WebLogic Event Server. Even the SpringSource Application Platform is built on topof it.    OSGi in Action is a comprehensive guide to OSGi with two primary goals.    First, it provides a clear introduction to OSGi concepts with examples that are relevant both for architects and developers. The central idea of OSGi is modularity, so you start by learning about OSGi bundles.    You'll then see how OSGi handles module lifecycles and follow up with how it promotes service-oriented interaction among application components.    With the core concepts well in hand,you'll explore numerous application scenarios and techniques. How much of OSGi do you actually need  How do you embed OSGi inside other containers  What are the best practices for migrating legacy systems to OSGi  How can you embrace and make the most of system dynamism     Expert authors Richard S. Hall, Karl Pauls, and Stuart McCulloch haveyears of experience both in building OSGi-based systems and in contributing to OSGi implementations such as Apache Felix.`,

    longDescription: `In December 2008, the Merb team announced thatthey will be collaborating with the Rails core team on the next versions of Merb and Rails. Rather than maintaining parallel tracks, Merb2 and Rails 3 will merge, preserving the flexible configuration and advanced features that Merb users love along with the rapid productivity and ease-of-use that makes Rails shine. As Engine Yard developer (and Manning author) Yehuda Katz puts it, "Effectively, Merb 2 is Rails 3."    Rails 3 in Action will provide a thorough introduction to Ruby-based web development using Rails. Like Rails 3 itself, this bookcombines Merb and Rails in the form of authors Yehuda Katz, Merb Lead Developer.    As a developer, you'll benefit from several big advantages to this change:  Rails becomes more modular, by building on rails core with the ability to opt in or out of specific components and making it possible to replace parts of Rails without disturbing otherparts.  Merb performance improvements flow into Rails, including benchmarking applications so developers can see which optimizations havereal-world impact.  A defined public API with a test suite, so usersand plugin developers have a stable API to build against.  A "core" version of Rails, like Merb's current core generator, that makes it easy to select just the parts that are important for your app.  DataMapper and Sequel support as first-class ORMs, along with ActiveRecord as the default.  Rack support in Rails 3, to improve the state of modular, sharable logic between applications.  The Rails 3 team is moving full steam ahead building the new version. The Merb team will startworking on Rails immediately, and also continue to fix bugs and resolve other major issues in the current release of Merb. Interim versions of Merb will help ease the transition to Rails 3. In particular, Merb releases with deprecation notices and other transitional mechanisms will assist developers in tracking down the changes between Merb 1.x and Rails 3.    If you've already learned Merb, Rails 3 in Action will help you parlay that knowledge into the new Rails code base. If you're a long time Rails developer, it will help you get up to speed with all the new Rails 3 features and changes.`,
